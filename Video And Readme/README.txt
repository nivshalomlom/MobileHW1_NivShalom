Mobile H1, Made by niv shalom

The app is a game where the player (the cavmen) needs to stay alive
as long as he can while a wolf rushes after him, when the wolf catches the player the game resets.

The player has 3 lives, after the wolf catches the player enough times to empty his lives supply, the app closes.
To keep playing after you ran out of lives open the app again.
